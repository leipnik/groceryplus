At home:
- add to list when something is out (is the thing I need to add already on the list? Is it marked "needed" or "complete"?) if it's not there at all, create it
- sometimes I want to add the same thing multiple times. Ie get three big vinegar containers 
- scroll through my entire list of "all items" to jog my memory about what we normally buy. I want to see all checked / unchecked, and be able to add something to the current list
- I want to be able to flag items that are absolutely required on the next trip, versus those we could do without if time is tight.

At home or elsewhere:
- I look at a recipe and want to import it, or at least add a few items that I don't already have at home or on my list. Ideally, if I import a recipe, my app tells me that some of the items are already checked, which probably means I have them at home. It allows me to unchecked them if I want. But the default is just "add all new/unchecked items"
- this recipe could be on any food blog / recipe site

At the store:
I want the most up to date list possible, at least up to the time I entered the store. I want all the items ordered by the sections of my store. Since all stores have slightly different layouts, I would ideally be able to order the sections myself, and move food items between sections. I should be able to to easily see the flagged items on the list, brighter or more obvious than the unflagged ones. I would also like to be able to collapse the list to only the flagged things. As I go through my list, I get confirmation that I'm checking things off, and even 5 seconds to undo, since I might check the wrong thing by mistake and I would have no idea what that thing was. 

After I check out:
I want to keep anything remaining still on the list, since I probably still need it but I got lazy.
